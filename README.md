# fire_detection
This project aims to build a machine learning classification model capable of detecting and categorizing wildfire events using data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite imagery. The model will leverage spatial and temporal trends in fire activity, along with associated environmental factors, to improve the accuracy of wildfire monitoring. The ultimate goal is to support proactive fire management through early detection, optimized resource deployment, and informed decision-making in regions vulnerable to wildfire outbreaks.
